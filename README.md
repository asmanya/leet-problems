# LeetCode Problem Solutions Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode problem solutions repository. This is a dedicated space where I document the problems I have solved on LeetCode. By maintaining this repository, I aim to track my progress in both logical problem-solving and coding skills as I tackle new challenges each day.


## > Motivation

The primary motivation behind this repository is to maintain a structured record of my LeetCode problem-solving journey. Here are a few reasons for doing so:

1. Skill Improvement: Tracking the problems I solve allows me to gauge how my problem-solving abilities and coding skills are improving over time.

2. Regularity: I am committed to maintaining regularity in solving problems on LeetCode. By consistently uploading my solutions here, I stay motivated to keep working on improving my skills.

## > Repository Structure

This repository is organized in a way that helps you easily navigate through my LeetCode solutions. Each problem is documented in its own directory.

Within this repository, I am actively engaged in solving a diverse range of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions primarily sourced from two well-regarded DSA sheets. Below are the links to these resources:


*DSA Sheet 1* : https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/

*DSA Sheet 2* : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-wKcV99KtO91dXdPkwmXGTdtyxAfk1mbPXQg81R9sFE/edit#gid=0




I have meticulously organized my solutions into two distinct folders, each dedicated to questions from the respective DSA sheet. This meticulous arrangement ensures a structured and efficient way of accessing the solutions.

### -- Folder Structure
The folders are structured to house topic-wise questions, ensuring easy navigation and reference. This approach facilitates a clear understanding of the questions and their corresponding solutions.

Additionally, you will find a *topics.txt* file included within this repository. This file serves as a comprehensive record of topics that I have marked for revision. Regularly revisiting these topics contributes to a more thorough understanding of DSA concepts and their application.


## > Contributions

While this repository primarily serves as a personal log of my journey, I welcome suggestions, and discussions. If you have any feedback, suggestions, or spot any errors in my solutions, please feel free to create issues or pull requests.

I appreciate your interest in my LeetCode problem-solving journey, and I hope that this repository can serve as a valuable resource for others looking to enhance their problem-solving and coding skills.


### Happy coding!
